About

This repository contains a completed 8-bit CPU built in Logisim as a .circ file. The design includes a main bus, ALU, registers, RAM, control logic, and basic I/O — implemented as part of my Study.com CS306 computer architecture project. The design was built following the structure taught in Ross McGowan’s Udemy course Design a CPU and published here so other students can study a finished, working example.

Features

- 8-bit data bus and registers

- Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) with basic ops

- Main system bus and control signals

- On-chip RAM module for instruction/data storage

- Logisim .circ file ready to open and simulate

Credits & context

Built for Study.com CS306 (project grade: 47 / 50).

Inspired by Ross McGowan — Design a CPU (Udemy). Not affiliated with Udemy or Study.com. The course helped fill gaps during development; this repo contains my own .circ implementation.
