## About this project

This repository contains a completed 8-bit CPU adhering to Von Neumann architecture and built in Logisim as a .circ file. The project was challenging because getting the ALU, registers, RAM, main bus, and control logic to work together required careful debugging and attention to timing.

I’m publishing this design so other students and self-learners have a working example to study. When I built it, I found that many resources explained theory but didn’t show a full, functioning CPU in Logisim. This file is meant to close that gap and make the learning process easier. This is a vital resource for any computer architecture course that requires logism circuitry.
