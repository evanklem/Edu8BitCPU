## About this project

This repository contains a completed 8-bit CPU built in Logisim as a .circ file. The project was challenging because getting the ALU, registers, RAM, main bus, and control logic to work together required careful debugging and attention to timing.

I’m publishing this design so other students and self-learners have a working example to study. When I built it, I found that many resources explained theory but didn’t show a full, functioning CPU in Logisim. This file is meant to close that gap and make the learning process easier.

## Features

8-bit data bus and registers

Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) with basic operations

Main system bus and control signals

On-chip RAM module for instruction/data storage

Logisim .circ file ready to open and simulate

## Credits & context

Built for my CS306 course (graded 47/50). Concepts also informed by Ross McGowan’s Design a CPU Udemy course. Implementation is my own.
